This project adds eco support to the vim editor. Most of the code is originally from Mick Koch's vim-coffee-script (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3590) and some of the features (most notably syntax highlighting) depend on installing that plugin as well.

Included features:
  - eco filetype detection
  - automatic indenting
  - syntax highlighting
  - surround.vim support
